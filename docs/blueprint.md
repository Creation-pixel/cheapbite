## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF), offering a bright, vibrant, lively feel, aligning with the 'Social' theme and is distinct without being overbearing.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6F7FF), same hue as primary but very desaturated, provides a calming backdrop that makes the primary color pop.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#6F00FF), a vivid, attention-getting analogous color shifted towards the purple side of the spectrum.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a neutral, modern aesthetic
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif adding a modern and computerized look
- Use clear and modern icons for navigation and actions. Icons should be simple and easily recognizable.
- Clean, card-based layouts to organize content. Ensure a consistent grid system for readability and visual appeal.
